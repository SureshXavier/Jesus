  <h1>Host Discovery using Lua Script</h1>
  <hr/>
	
  <p>This Lua script is designed to scan a network for active hosts and report their IP addresses. It uses the Lua programming language to perform the scan. The script sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to potential hosts and waits for a response. If a response is received, the script reports the IP address of the responding host.</p>
	<hr/>
